# Udacity Project: Item Catalog
This project implements the Udacity Project Item Catalog. Running the application.py creates a webserver located at http://localhost:5000/, that hosts a catalog that uses security credentials from Google OAuth2 to give access.

## /templates

Here is all of the HTML that is used. Most items are named after their intended use. For instance, edititem.html allows the user to edit the item. The use of a header file and main file for some general templating was used.

## /static

Here is where the CSS & JS files are located. Index.js has the primary javascript which deals with setting up buttons on the page. There is very minimal css in the dashboard.css as well to help with minor formatting.

Also included is some third party vendor libraries such as angular, bootstrap, and jquery.

## Database Setup

In order to create the database run the following commands:
```
python database_setup.py
python databaseSeed.py
```
database_setup.py does the work of creating 3 tables and classes Users, CatalogItem, and Category. These are declared with sqlalchemy which allows them to be referenced easily from python.

databaseSeed.py does the work of seeding the tables with data.

##application.py

Here is a list of endpoints configured in python.
http://localhost:5000/
http://localhost:5000/login
http://localhost:5000/additem
http://localhost:5000/success
http://localhost:5000/category/<int:category_id>/
http://localhost:5000/catalogItem/<int:catalog_id>/
http://localhost:5000/editItem/<int:catalog_id>/
http://localhost:5000/catalogItem/<int:catalog_id>/delete
http://localhost:5000/catalog.json
http://localhost:5000/gconnect
http://localhost:5000/gdisconnect

- /editItem/<int:catalog_id>/ is used to edit the item details for a specific catalog item
- /catalogItem/<int:catalog_id>/delete is used to delete a specific catalog item
- /catalog.json gives a json of the catalog

- /gdisconnect disconnects from Google OAuth2
